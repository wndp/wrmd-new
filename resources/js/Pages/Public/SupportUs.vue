          Dear friend of wildlife,
        </h3>
        <p class="text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">
          The worldwide impact on wildlife from expanding human populations, environmental degradation, climate change and disease epidemics is rapidly increasing the need for wildlife hospitals to establish and maintain electronic record keeping. Databases that enable wildlife rehabilitators to standardize, streamline and improve wildlife care help save hundreds of thousands of wild animals and provide early warning to health agencies of the onset or potential for wildlife and human disease epidemics.

        <h4>Wildlife Rehabilitation MD</h4>
        <p>A growing number of wildlife rehabilitation hospitals in the US and other countries now depend on Wildlife Rehabilitation MD. This free on-line medical database is designed specifically for wildlife rehabilitators to collect, manage, analyze, archive and share patient data. Because so many wildlife hospitals operate under significant financial constraints, free access to this database is critical to saving more lives.</p>
        <h4>WRMD Successes</h4>
        <p>Since the launch of the database in 2012, WRMD has seen a 30-fold increase in the number of patient cases entered. In addition we have:</p>
        <ul><li>expanded to numerous hospitals across the US, Canada and Belize.</li> <li>been endorsed by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.</li> <li>upgraded WRMD including significant technical and user enhancements and a 140% speed increase.</li> <li>completed a successful Kickstarter fundraising campaign that ultimately generated over $6000.</li> <li>presented WRMD at state, national and international wildlife symposiums.</li></ul>
        <h4>Your Support of WRMD</h4>
        <p>Demand for this free database is growing rapidly. The data being collected will transform the professional field of wildlife rehabilitation and have an enormous impact on wildlife worldwide. Your significant financial support will help us meet the needs of wildlife rehabilitation hospitals using Wildlife Rehabilitation MD around the world.</p>
        <p>We would welcome the chance to speak with you about Wildlife Rehabilitation MD and how your contribution will support specific developments of the database project in the future.</p>
        <h4>Thank you,</h4>
        <p>Devin Dombrowski and Rachel Avilla, co-founders<br>Wildlife Rehabilitation MD</p>
